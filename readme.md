# Ghostwriter

Ghostwriter is a replacement for the prerender.io service. In contrast to prerender.io it does not limit serving of prerendered pages to a specific set of spiders. For this reason the web application has to be able to handle prerendered content on client side (which is usually not an issue if structured properly).

This is a complete example based on React. You will find the project itself here: https://github.com/core-process/ghostwriter
